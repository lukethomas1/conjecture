# conjecture
A short python script to test Collatz conjecture. Look it up, its pretty cool.

Wrote this just to see if the conjecture held up. Which of course it does. At least until 15,000, according to this program. I'll prove the theorem some other time.

Also added a feature that tracks the number of loops it takes to get to 1, because I noticed a trend that certain amounts of loops were common. Turns out that every number of loops is used at least once if you go high enough, at least as far as I've tested it anyway.
